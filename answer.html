           <p class="purple-text col-md-8">How should I help my child reduce the number of times she showers?
                                My daughter is 14 and she usually showers five or six times a day for up to an hour at a time. This often makes her late to school because she is unable to leave the shower in the morning, and the whole family has to wait for her because my husband and I carpool to work after we drop her off. She is making all of us late but we cannot force her to come out of the shower. In addition she is using huge bottles of shower products very quickly due to how often she showers, and she always needs to buy more. I have refused to give her money to spent on these things in the past but she would cry and totally break down. What should I do? Am I being an enabler? How should I help her while respecting her needs?</p>

           <p class="purple-text col-md-8">Hi there! This is definitely very frustrating for the entire family. If you are changing your own routine to accommodate your child’s OCD-related behavior, then you may be enabling your child. In the future, I would suggest telling her the exact time when you and your husband will be leaving the house in the morning, and that if she is not ready on time, you will leave without her. This may feel harsh but it will help her realize that she doesn’t _actually_ need those couple more minutes in the shower. Similarly, maybe it would be helpful to set a nonnegotiable budget for how much money she can spend on shower products every month. Only by enforcing these rules can she make progress to overcome her OCD-related behaviors.</p>
